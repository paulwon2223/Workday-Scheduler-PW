## Homework assignment #5

### Overview:

- For this assignment, I was tasked to create a working day scheduler which users can save their tasts for each hour of the day. 

### Processs:

- During my process in creating the work day scheduler, MomentJs was used to display the updated date and the time. Furthermore to display the actual columns and the row for the time block, I created the necessary elements in my js file, and appended those elements to my html file. 
-  To display a certain color on the task-block container depending on the time (e.g. the box will turn gray when it has passed that specific time, and will show a red color during present time), I created an if statement with the time conditions. 
- In order to save the users task, I used local storage to store the user's input
